        <p>This method applies when a conduit is installed inside a wall, against a wall or spaced less than 0.3 x D (overall diameter of the cable) from the wall. Method B also applies for cables installed in trunking / cable duct against a wall or suspended from a wall and cables installed in building cavities. </p></td></tr>
