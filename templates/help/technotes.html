    <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
        
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>These technical notes provide details on how Cablesizer is constructed, and in particular, the limitations of the sizing calculations. Firstly, it must be stressed that these calculations are for <b>low voltage cables only (<1kV)</b> and there is currently no support given to cable sizing at higher voltages.</p>
    <p>Generally speaking, Cablesizer covers most of the common cable sizing applications for domestic and industrial scenarios, but does not currently cover any special cases. If you'd like a particular case included, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@cablesizer.com">contact@cablesizer.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>2. NEC Cable Sizing</h3>
    <p>The following technical notes are applicable for the NEC cable sizing calculations:</p>
    <ul class="indented">
        <li>Ampacity calculations are based on NFPA 70, "National Electricity Code", 2011 edition</li>
        <li>Voltage drop calculations are based on standard voltage drop formulae. Cable resistances and reactances are approximate and are based on NEC Chapter 9 Table 9 (in PVC conduit) and estimates based on manufacturer data for cable sizes >1250kcmil. These impedance values need to be verified by the user.</li>
        <li>No support given to cable sizing for voltages >1kV</li>
        <li>No support for sizing of cables supported on messenger (NEC Table 310.15(B)(20)), bare conductors in free air (NEC Table 310.15(B)(21)), flexible cords (NEC Article 400) and integrated gas spacer cables (NEC Article 326)</li>
        <li>No support for sizing cables smaller than 14 AWG</li>
        <li>No support for the special cases of AC and MC cables in Article 310.15(B)(3) Notes 4 and 5</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. IEC Cable Sizing</h3>
    <p>The following technical notes are applicable for the IEC cable sizing calculations:</p>
    <ul class="indented">
        <li>Ampacity calculations are based on IEC 60364-5-52, "Low voltage electrical installations - Part 5-52: Selection and erection of electrical equipment - Wiring Systems", 2009</li>
        <li>Short circuit temperature rise calculations are based on IEC 60364-5-54, "Low voltage electrical installations - Part 5-54: Selection and erection of electrical equipment - Earthing arrangements and protective conductors" 2001</li>
        <li>Voltage drop calculations are based on standard voltage drop formulae. Cable resistances and reactances are approximate and are based on typical conservative values and need to be verified by the user.</li>
        <li>For derating factors of grouped cables in free air (IEC 60364-5-52 Table B.52.20), the number of tray or ladder layers only go from 1 to 3. The 6th layer is omitted.</li>
        <li>For ambient and soil temperatures (IEC 60364-5-52 Table B.52.14 and Table B.52.15), only the temperatures from 10&degC to 60&degC are used. All higher temperatures are omitted.</li>
        <li>For underground clearances (IEC 60364-5-52 Table B.52.18 and Table B.52.19), the clearances 0.125m, 1m and one cable diameter were omitted for the harmonization between cables that are direct buried (Table B.52.18) and those buried in conduit (Table B.52.19). </li>
    </ul>
