Cablesizer
==========

Cablesizer is a Django web application for sizing electrical power/control cables to IEC 60364-5-52 and NEC (NFPA 70) standards. 

Cable sizing generally isn't a daily activity in the life of an electrical design engineer, and pen-and-paper methods are tedious 
and time consuming. So Cablesizer was made to be an easy-to-use, automatic cable sizing application without requiring any accounts 
or logins.
